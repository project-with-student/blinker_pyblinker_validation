"""Regression tests for segment-aware annotation merging.

Overview
========
These tests replay two GUI scenarios against synthetic data to guard against the
"missing annotations" regression. Both use a single-channel 300 s Raw object and
a hardcoded CSV with 30 annotations (``annotations_input.csv``). Additional
ground-truth CSVs provide human-auditable expectations:

* ``expected_full_merge.csv`` — what the combined annotations should look like
  after opening the **entire** file (0–300 s) and adding three manual markers at
  5, 9, and 12 seconds.
* ``expected_middle_merge.csv`` — what the combined annotations should look like
  after opening only **100–200 s**, adding markers at 110 and 120 seconds, and
  merging those edits back without losing any pre-existing in-window rows.

Flowchart-style steps per test
------------------------------
1. Load the static 30-row CSV into a DataFrame.
2. Build a 300 s Raw with a single zero-valued channel (100 Hz).
3. Extract the relevant window using ``split_annotations_by_window``.
4. Convert the window to ``mne.Annotations`` (time-shifted to the window start),
   append manual markers, and optionally plot when ``ANNOTATION_TEST_PLOT=1``.
5. Convert edited annotations back to a global DataFrame with
   ``frame_from_annotations``.
6. Merge against the original annotations with ``merge_annotations`` to rebuild
   the full timeline.
7. Assert counts and compare against the appropriate ground-truth CSV to ensure
   no annotations were dropped or shifted.

        This test simulates the workflow of opening the **entire** file in the
        GUI, adding a few manual markers, and then merging the edited annotations
        back into the original annotation table.

        Steps
        -----
        1. Load the static input annotation CSV into a DataFrame.
        2. Create a 300 s mock Raw instance at 100 Hz.
        3. Select all annotations that fall inside [0, raw.duration] using
           :func:`split_annotations_by_window`.
        4. Time-shift the segment so that local onsets start at 0 and convert it
           to :class:`mne.Annotations` via :func:`annotations_from_frame`.
        5. Create three manual annotations at 5, 9, and 12 seconds (relative to
           the global timeline) and append them to the local annotations.
        6. Convert the combined annotations back to a global DataFrame with
           :func:`frame_from_annotations` using ``base_time=start``.
        7. Merge the edited segment back into the original annotation frame
           using :func:`merge_annotations`.
        8. Assert that specific indices exist and that their ``onset`` and
           ``description`` match the expected values.
        9. Convert the merged frame to :class:`mne.Annotations`, attach it to the
           Raw object, and plot (blocking) for visual inspection.

        Expected behavior / output
        --------------------------
        * The merged DataFrame must contain three new rows with description
          ``"manual_add"`` at onsets 5.0, 9.0, and 12.0 seconds.
        * No existing annotations should be lost or time-shifted unexpectedly.
        * The assertions on index presence and field values must all pass.
        * The test itself does not return anything; it passes if no assertion
          fails and no exception is raised. It prints a confirmation message and,
          when plotting is enabled, shows a Raw plot with all annotations.
